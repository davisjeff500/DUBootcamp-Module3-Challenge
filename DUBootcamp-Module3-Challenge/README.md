# DUBootcamp-Mod3-Challenge Solution- Personal Portfolio by Jeff Davis

<h2>Deployed Solution Location</h2>

<h2>Solution Method</h2>

I first used pseudocode to break up the functions, conditionals and validation required to fulfill the requirements of the challenge. I then heavily used MDN for background, and went back through the activities for Module 3.  I employed decision making using if statements, and used strict equality checking. I had some trouble with local and global values but was able to sort out the proper placement of variables. I used the reset code by Maria and my interface differs slightly in font sizes, but felt it was better to get used to using the reset.css in my work.
